    <p> <b>Tiramisu</b> is a coffee-flavoured Italian dessert. It is made of ladyfingers dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of eggs, sugar, and mascarpoe cheese, flavoured with cocoa. The recipe has been adapted into many varieties of cakes and other desserts. Done correctly, a classic tiramisù can be transcendent. A creamy dessert of espresso-soaked ladyfingers surrounded by lightly sweetened whipped cream and a rich mascarpone, tiramisù relies heavily on the quality of its ingredients.

                        Dark rum is best, but you can use brandy or your favorite coffee liqueur.

                <dt><b>Egg whites or whipped cream?</b>
                     <dd>
                        Most tiramisu recipes use whipped egg whites OR whipped cream in the mascarpone cream layers. Egg whites contribute a more airy texture, while whipped cream makes the filling a bit more rich. This recipe actually uses both, so you're getting both delightful.

                    <b>Are the eggs cooked?</b>
                    <dd>
                        Tiramisu is a no-bake dessert. The egg yolks are gently cooked on the stovetop. but the egg whites are raw. Purchase pasteurized eggs because they are safe to consume raw.

                <dt><b>What size pan to use?</b>
                </dt>
                <dd>This particular tiramisu recipe yields a large volume and the pan will be very full. Make sure your pan is large enough. I recommend a 9x13 inch dish with at least a 12-14 cup capacity. This 4 quart dish is wonderful too.</dd>
